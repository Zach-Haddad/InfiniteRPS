A simple sidescrolling RPS game that pits you, a shape shifter, against an infinite amount of rocks, pieces of paper, and pairs of scissors.  Shift into the correct form to defeat your foes!  Levels become progressively more difficult as the number of enemies and the speed at which they approach increases.

### Instructions

###Technologies
